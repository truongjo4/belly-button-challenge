# belly-button-challenge

## Introduction ##

This small project involved creating an interactive dashboard via d3.JS, Plotly and Javascript.

The dataset used for this study comes from the [Belly Button Biodiversity Dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/). Through this dataset, it was found that 70% of people have the same or similar species of microbial organisms (known as Operational taxonomic units - OTUs) residing at their navels. 

[We explored this trend using a bar chart and bubble graph.](https://truongjo4.github.io/belly-button-challenge/)
